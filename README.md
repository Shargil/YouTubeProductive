# YouTube Productive

Create the YouTube that grows you.
YouTube has amazing algorithms. Using magic, they know what videos going to keep us watching YouTube the longest.

Too many times we find our self's watching stupid videos at 3 AM or not doing the work that we should.
But blocking YouTube all together is not the solution.
There is too much stuff to learn, too many interesting quality videos to watch.
The time has come.
